# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alessandro Merenda

I'm a Data Engineering and MLOps enthusiast currently growing through hands-on projects, training, and real-world simulation.  
I'm studying **Automation & Systems Engineering** at the University of Padova and attending a technical program in **Advanced Data Analysis**.  
Starting from July 2025, I will also be joining **BIT SpA** as a Junior Data Engineer.

My work focuses on building scalable, production-ready data pipelines and ML workflows, with attention to automation, modularity, and reproducibility. I enjoy connecting tools like Docker, Airflow, FastAPI, and tracking systems to simulate end-to-end ML lifecycles.

Right now Iâ€™m working on:

- Designing and orchestrating ETL pipelines with Apache Airflow
- Building containerized Python modules for image anomaly detection
- Practicing full-stack MLOps: from data generation to inference and automation
- Exploring modern GenAI techniques and prompting strategies
- Developing my personal operating system project, **WOLLI**, focused on self-evolving AI components

## ðŸŒ± Learning Mindset

I'm not just learning tools â€” I'm learning **how to think in systems**.  
How to build, automate, test, and improve.  
I believe in writing clean, modular code and in simulating real-world problems, not just toy examples.

This GitHub profile will evolve as I complete more projects and grow as an engineer.  
Thanks for visiting!
